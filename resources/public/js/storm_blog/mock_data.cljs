They vary from crisp, clear blue, to turquoise, to an almost green color throughout the day and with light changes--but they are always magnificent. The photos I have posted here are not photoshopped or altered in anyway--any change at all is a disservice to this level of beauty."}

Though day trips here are popular from the Croatian coastal towns, I strongly recommend a full side trip if at all possible-- one day is simply not enough. We spent 7 hours each day hiking. For obvious reasons, be sure to bring plenty of water, as well as food. There are snacks and a small grill available in the textk, but the quality is about what you would expect from a small restaurant in the middle of nowhere with no competition."}

We made our way back down the lakes ourselves, which was a delightful adventure. There were trails the entire way, but some were very steep in places. I definitely don’t recommend walking back if you’re not comfortable on reasonably rugged trails. Beware the distance, as well: though we greatly enjoyed the experience, what we thought would be a straightforward walk back was actually much, much (read: a couple hours) longer once we factored in all of the inlets we had to curve around. Worth it, though! Except for 2-3 small groups, we were completely alone with the lakes during this leg of our trip."}

Downside, it’s a bit more crowded and more “on the beaten path”. Absolutely worth visiting, but a distinct environment from the more tranquil Upper Lakes."}

Beware the limited hours, especially for the grocery stores. We didn’t eat any of our meals out while here, instead opting to spend 42.52 USD on groceries (3 breakfasts, 2 lunches, and 2 dinners for 2 adults). We cooked simple hot meals for breakfast and dinner--nothing complex, but we were definitely starving due to the level of activity."}
